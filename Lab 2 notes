Before using an I/O port, it must be set as input or output by setting the PORT<x>_DIR
register to 1 (output) or clearing it to 0 (input). Note: <x> is a placeholder for the port letter identifier,
i.e. PORTD_DIR

Using the PORT<x>_DIRCLR, PORT<x>_DIRSET and PORT<x>_DIRTGL, individual pins on a port can
be defined as input or output. I.E. setting PORTF_DIRSET or PORTF_DIRCLR to 0100 0000_2 (0x40) 
will define pin 6 on port F as an output or an input respectively without altering the other pins.

PORT<x>_OUTCLR/OUTSET/OUTTGL will control the activation levels of output ports. By setting
the OUT register for a port, its output pins will be driven high. Clearing the OUT register
will drive output pins low.
